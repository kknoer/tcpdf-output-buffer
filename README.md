tcpdf_output_buffer
===================

A output buffer technique to be used in combination with the brilliant TCPDF library created by @nicolaasuni (http://www.tcpdf.org)

* I take ZERO credit for the TCPDF library.

This can be used to generate fancy looking invoices, reports, etc. on the fly.  Database output can easily be added using this output buffer technique.

Both HTML and CSS are interpreted extremely well by this library, but some elements and properties will need to be tested.
